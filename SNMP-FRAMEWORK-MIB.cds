    i"An identifier that uniquely identifies a
                 Security Model of the Security Subsystem within
                 this SNMP Management Architecture.

                 The values for securityModel are allocated as
                 follows:

                 - The zero value does not identify any particular
                   security model.

                 - Values between 1 and 255, inclusive, are reserved
                   for standards-track Security Models and are
                   managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
                   (IANA).
                 - Values greater than 255 are allocated to
                   enterprise-specific Security Models.  An
                   enterprise-specific securityModel value is defined
                   to be:

                   enterpriseID * 256 + security model within
                   enterprise

                   For example, the fourth Security Model defined by
                   the enterprise whose enterpriseID is 1 would be
                   259.

                 This scheme for allocation of securityModel
                 values allows for a maximum of 255 standards-
                 based Security Models, and for a maximum of
                 256 Security Models per enterprise.

                 It is believed that the assignment of new
                 securityModel values will be rare in practice
                 because the larger the number of simultaneously
                 utilized Security Models, the larger the
                 chance that interoperability will suffer.
                 Consequently, it is believed that such a range
                 will be sufficient.  In the unlikely event that
                 the standards committee finds this number to be
                 insufficient over time, an enterprise number
                 can be allocated to obtain an additional 256
                 possible values.

                 Note that the most significant bit must be zero;
                 hence, there are 23 bits allocated for various
                 organizations to design and define non-standard
                 securityModels.  This limits the ability to
                 define new proprietary implementations of Security
                 Models to the first 8,388,608 enterprises.

                 It is worthwhile to note that, in its encoded
                 form, the securityModel value will normally
                 require only a single byte since, in practice,
                 the leftmost bits will be zero for most messages
                 and sign extension is suppressed by the encoding
                 rules.

                 As of this writing, there are several values
                 of securityModel defined for use with SNMP or
                 reserved for use with supporting MIB objects.
                 They are as follows:

                     1  reserved for SNMPv1

                 Objects of this type are for identification, not for
                 addressing, even though it is possible that an
                 address may have been used in the generation of
                 a specific value.

                 The value for this object may not be all zeros or
                 all 'ff'H or the empty (zero length) string.

                 The initial value for this object may be configured
                 via an operator console entry or via an algorithmic
                 function.  In the latter case, the following
                 example algorithm is recommended.

                 In cases where there are multiple engines on the
                 same system, the use of this algorithm is NOT
                 appropriate, as it would result in all of those
                 engines ending up with the same ID value.

                    1 - as defined by this architecture, see item 3
                        below.

                    Note that this allows existing uses of the
                    engineID (also known as AgentID [RFC1910]) to
                    co-exist with any new uses.

                 2) The snmpEngineID has a length of 12 octets.

                    The first four octets are set to the binary
                    equivalent of the agent's SNMP management
                    private enterprise number as assigned by the
                    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
                    For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned
                    { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would
                    be assigned '000002b8'H.

                    The remaining eight octets are determined via
                    one or more enterprise-specific methods. Such
                    methods must be designed so as to maximize the
                    possibility that the value of this object will
                    be unique in the agent's administrative domain.
                    For example, it may be the IP address of the SNMP
                    entity, or the MAC address of one of the
                    interfaces, with each address suitably padded
                    with random octets.  If multiple methods are
                    defined, then it is recommended that the first
                    octet indicate the method being used and the
                    remaining octets be a function of the method.

                 3) The length of the octet string varies.

                    The first four octets are set to the binary
                    equivalent of the agent's SNMP management
                    private enterprise number as assigned by the
                    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
                    For example, if Acme Networks has been assigned
                    { enterprises 696 }, the first four octets would
                    be assigned '000002b8'H.

                    The very first bit is set to 1. For example, the
                    above value for Acme Networks now changes to be
                    '800002b8'H.

                    The fifth octet indicates how the rest (6th and
                    following octets) are formatted. The values for
                    the fifth octet are:

                      0     - reserved, unused.

                              lowest IEEE MAC address, canonical
                              order

                 To facilitate internationalization, this

                 IS 10646-1 character set, encoded as an octet
                 string using the UTF-8 transformation format
                 described in [RFC2279].

                 Since additional code points are added by
                 amendments to the 10646 standard from time
                 to time, implementations must be prepared to
                 encounter any code point from 0x00000000 to
                 0x7fffffff.  Byte sequences that do not
                 correspond to the valid UTF-8 encoding of a
                 code point or are outside this range are
                 prohibited.

                 The use of control codes should be avoided.

                 When it is necessary to represent a newline,
                 the control code sequence CR LF should be used.

                 The use of leading or trailing white space should
                 be avoided.

                 For code points not directly supported by user
                 interface hardware or software, an alternative
                 means of entry and display, such as hexadecimal,
                 may be provided.

                 For information encoded in 7-bit US-ASCII,
                 the UTF-8 encoding is identical to the
                 US-ASCII encoding.

                 UTF-8 may require multiple bytes to represent a
                 single character / code point; thus the length
                 of this object in octets may be different from
                 the number of characters encoded.  Similarly,
                 size constraints refer to the number of encoded
                 octets, not the number of characters represented
                 by an encoding.

                 Note that when this TC is used for an object that
                 is used or envisioned to be used as an index, then
                 a SIZE restriction MUST be specified so that the
                 number of sub-identifiers for any object instance
                 does not exceed the limit of 128, as defined by
                 [RFC3416].

                 Note that the size of an SnmpAdminString object is
                 measured in octets, not characters.

                     - Updated various administrative information.
                     - Corrected some typos.
                     - Corrected typo in description of SnmpEngineID
                       that led to range overlap for 127.
                     - Changed '255a' to '255t' in definition of
                       SnmpAdminString to align with current SMI.
                     - Reworded 'reserved' for value zero in
                       DESCRIPTION of SnmpSecurityModel.
                     - The algorithm for allocating security models
                       should give 256 per enterprise block, rather
                       than 255.
                     - The example engine ID of 'abcd' is not
                       legal. Replaced with '800002b804616263'H based
                       on example enterprise 696, string 'abc'.
                     - Added clarification that engineID should
                       persist across re-initializations.

                 When incrementing this object's value would
                 cause it to exceed its maximum,
                 snmpEngineBoots is incremented as if a
                 re-initialization had occurred, and this
                 object's value consequently reverts to zero.
